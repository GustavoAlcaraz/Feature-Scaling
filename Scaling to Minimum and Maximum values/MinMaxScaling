Scaling to Minimum and Maximum values - MinMaxScaling

Minimum and maximum scaling squeezes the values between 0 and 1. It subtracts the minimum value from 
all the observations, and then divides it by the value range:

X_scaled = (X - X.min / (X.max - X.min)

The result of the above transformation is a distribution which values vary within the range of 0 to 1. 
But the mean is not centered at zero and the standard deviation varies across variables. The shape of 
a min-max scaled distribution will be similar to the original variable, but the variance may change, 
so not identical. This scaling technique is also sensitive to outliers.

This technique will not normalize the distribution of the data thus if this is the desired outcome, 
we should implement any of the techniques discussed in variable transformations.

In a nutshell, MinMaxScaling:

does not center the mean at 0
variance varies across variables
may not preserve the shape of the original distribution
the minimum and maximum values are 0 and 1.
sensitive outliers
In this demo
We will perform scaling to minimum and maximum values
