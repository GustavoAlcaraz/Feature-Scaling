Scaling to quantiles and median - RobustScaling

In this procedure the median is removed from the observations and then they are scaled to 
the inter-quantile range (IQR). The IQR is the range between the 1st quartile (25th quantile) 
and the 3rd quartile (75th quantile).

X_scaled = X - X_median / ( X.quantile(0.75) - X.quantile(0.25) )

This robust scaling method produces more robust estimates for the center and range of the variable, 
and is recommended if the data shows outliers.

In a nutshell, RobustScaling:

centers the median at 0
variance varies across variables
may not preserve the shape of the original distribution
the minimum and maximum values vary.
robust outliers
In this demo
We will perform robust scaling using Scikit-learn
